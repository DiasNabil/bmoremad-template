# Crisis Response - BMAD Incident Coordination Workflow

Orchestrates rapid multi-agent crisis response with coordinated incident management, root cause analysis, and recovery planning.

## Usage
```bash
/BMad/crisis-response [severity]    # Activate crisis response team
/BMad/incident-assess              # Rapid impact assessment
/BMad/emergency-fix                # Coordinate emergency fixes
/BMad/crisis-comms                 # Manage crisis communications
/BMad/post-mortem                  # Post-incident analysis
```
