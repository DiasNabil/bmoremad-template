## Workflow Architecture Overview

### Core Architectural Principles

#### 1. Brain-Inspired Multi-Agent Coordination
The BMAD architecture mimics neural network patterns where specialized agents (neurons) coordinate through intelligent messaging protocols to achieve complex objectives.

```yaml
Architecture Pattern: "Neural Network Coordination"
Agents: 20+ specialized agents
Communication: MCP-based secure messaging
Coordination: Parallel execution with sync points
Intelligence: Context-aware pattern matching
```

#### 2. Hierarchical Workflow Structure
Workflows are organized in three tiers, each building upon the previous level's capabilities:

```yaml
Tier 1 - Foundation Workflows (4):
  - init-prd: Requirements definition
  - init-architecture: System design foundation
  - shard-stories: Atomic development units
  - run-next-story: Iterative implementation

Tier 2 - Advanced Management (4):
  - manage-debt: Technical debt orchestration
  - crisis-response: Incident management coordination
  - evolve-system: Strategic transformation planning
  - review-advanced: Multi-dimensional quality assurance

Tier 3 - Integration Intelligence (3):
  - sync-dependencies: Cross-team coordination
  - monitor-impact: Post-deployment intelligence
  - integrate-feedback: Continuous improvement loops
```

#### 3. MCP Server Integration Architecture
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide secure, scalable communication infrastructure:

```yaml
MCP Architecture:
  GitHub Server: Repository management and version control
  PostgreSQL Server: Data persistence and analytics
  Redis Server: Real-time caching and coordination
  Filesystem Server: Document and artifact management
  Notion Server: Collaboration and documentation
  ShadCN Server: UI component management
  Memory Server: Context and learning persistence
  Firecrawl Server: External intelligence gathering

Security Model: "Enterprise Zero-Trust"
Permissions: Role-based per agent group
Authentication: Mutual TLS with certificate rotation
```

### Workflow Orchestration Engine

#### Parallel Coordination System
The system supports true parallel execution using Claude Code's multiple tool call capability:

```python
class WorkflowOrchestrator:
    def coordinate_parallel_execution(self, workflow_pattern, agents):
        """
        Orchestrates true parallel execution of multiple agents
        using Claude Code's native multi-tool capability
        """
        # Resource allocation with conflict prevention
        resources = self.allocate_exclusive_resources(agents)
        
        # Simultaneous agent launch via multiple Task calls
        parallel_tasks = [
            self.create_agent_task(agent, resources[agent])
            for agent in agents
        ]
        
        # Execute all tasks in single message for true parallelism
        results = self.execute_simultaneous(parallel_tasks)
        
        # Intelligent synchronization and result aggregation
        return self.synchronize_and_aggregate(results)
```

#### Natural Language Processing
Advanced NLP enables conversational workflow triggering:

```python
def detect_workflow_pattern(user_input, context):
    """
    Intelligent pattern detection with 90%+ accuracy
    """
    patterns = {
        "greenfield": ["nouveau projet", "démarrer projet", "from scratch"],
        "sprint-planning": ["planifier sprint", "préparer sprint", "backlog"],
        "crisis-response": ["emergency", "down", "incident", "urgent"],
        "manage-debt": ["technical debt", "code quality", "refactor"],
        "evolve-system": ["modernize", "migrate", "architecture evolution"]
    }
    
    confidence_scores = analyze_semantic_similarity(user_input, patterns)
    return select_highest_confidence_pattern(confidence_scores)
```
